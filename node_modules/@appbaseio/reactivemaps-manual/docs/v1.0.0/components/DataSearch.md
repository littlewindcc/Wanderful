A `DataSearch` sensor component creates a searchbox UI widget with an autocomplete functionality. It is used for applying full-text search across one or more fields.

Example uses:
* Searching for a rental listing by its `name` or `description` field.
* Creating an e-commerce search box for finding products by their listing properties.

### Usage

```js
<DataSearch
  componentId="SearchSensor"
  appbaseField={["group_venue", "group_city"]}
  title="Search"
  placeholder="Search for cities or venues"
  autocomplete={true}
/>
```

### Props

    unique id of the sensor, can be referenced in an actuatorâ€™s react prop.
- **appbaseField** `String or Array`  
    data field(s) on which the search query will be aplied to. If you want to search across multiple fields, pass them as an `Array`.
- **title** `String` [optional]  
    Sets the title of the component to be shown in the UI.
- **placeholder** `String` [optional]  
    Sets the placeholder text to be shown in the searhbox input field. Defaults to "Search...".
